The goal was to create a fast, easy to use shopping fully integrated with Nike's brand storytelling. The project took nearly two years (I was on it for the last 10 months). The site is designed to fit into 32 languages in 50 countries. I worked all over the designs, but where I most of all made an impact was on the design of gridwalls, cart, checkout, product detail pages, navigations, landing pages (gift cards and kids), mylocker, order/return pages, profile settings, help pages, iconography and form fields.
